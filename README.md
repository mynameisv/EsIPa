EsIPa
--------
You can prononce "He Zi Pa"

Stands for Empire's Stager IP and Port Alterer



`EsIPa` is a very simple tool that change the IP address and port from a base64-encoded Empire's stager.

It work for Empire 1.6 and previous


But why !!?
----------------
Because, sometimes, you have a complexe C&C architecture and the listener's IP set in Empire is not the one the need to use. You know : Nat, SNat, Source routing, Double Nat...


Do I use that script ?
----------------
No ;-)

That's my opinion but it's much better to have your own stager: optimized, not detected by   Proxy/IDS/IPS/Endpoint Protection, managing several cases like temporary network error, managing multiple IP adresses...


Last word ?
